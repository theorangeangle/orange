Breaking News: The Gridlock Cluster - a Clusterio MMO event - is launching on June 12th!

This event is simple: it's a pre-set grid of servers each connected by teleporting trains (that are ALL trying to kill you), all working to avoid the worst nightmare an engineer can face... a train deadlock!

Our gridlock will spin out like a spider web, with new servers launched often and open for everyone to join, no password or inital whitelist.

New servers will need a landing party of engineers who will be sent in to establish a base of operations. Only once all the biters on the map are cleared and a satellite launched, will they be able to transfer items. 

The inital goal is to beat our previous record of over **2 million satellites launched** in the last event. As the cluster expands, bonus features will be revealed.

Engineer, your mission - should you choose to accept it - is to join us, starting with the inital launch on **July 12, 2019 at 19:00/7pm UTC**. There will always be new servers looking for fighters, and older ones in need of optimization.

Required mods are:
NONE! - We are running scenarios instead! Details about the scenario and the soft-whitelist are on discord.

If you are [TBD pitch about UpCloud's services], check them out and recieve [TBD discount] with code "GRIDLOCK".

**The primary communication channel will be on a dedicated "Gridlock Cluster" discord guild. You can join at [vanity URL] for dedicated voice + text channels. This event shown off by several notable Content Creators, and you can find their links on The Gridlock discord.**

With all of this awesome-sauce sadly comes some rules. Firstly, don't be a dick. Secondly, don't remove stuff that works, especially if it's actively producing items**!** Third, use common sense and common decency when communicating with other players - we are all humans here.

And an immense "thank you" to our sponsor, UpCloud! They are providing us with all the servers for the event
