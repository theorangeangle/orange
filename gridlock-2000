Breaking News: The Gridlock Cluster - a Clusterio MMO event - is launching on June 12th!

This event is simple: it's a pre-set grid of servers each connected by teleporting trains (that are ALL trying to kill you), all working to avoid the worst nightmare an engineer can face... a train deadlock!

Our gridlock will spin out like a spider web, with new servers launched often and open for everyone to join, no password or inital whitelist.

New servers will need a landing party of engineers who will be sent in to establish a base of operations. Only once all the biters on the map are cleared and a satellite launched, will they be able to transfer items. 

The inital goal is to beat our previous record of over **2 million satellites launched** in the last event (which should have blocked out the sun!). But we thought that maybe the sun *should* be blocked out! As our gridlock progresses, the sunlight will slowly be blocked out over time!

Engineer, your mission - should you choose to accept it - is to join us, starting with the inital launch on **July 12, 2019 at 19:00/7pm UTC**. There will always be new servers looking for fighters, and older ones in need of optimization.

Required mods are:
NONE! - We are running scenarios instead!

We are running a soft-whitelist, meaning that after a node has been connected, some restrictions will be applied as a precaution. However, you can apply for whitelist access on the discord guild - and any participants from the last event will have full access already.

An immense "thank you" to our sponsor, UpCloud! They are providing us with all the servers for the event, which are more than up to the challenge with some awesome hardware.

If you are [TBD pitch about UpCloud's services], check them out and recieve [TBD discount] with code "GRIDLOCK".

**The primary communication channel will be on a dedicated "Gridlock Cluster" discord guild. You can join at [vanity URL] for dedicated voice + text channels. This event shown off by several notable Content Creators, and you can find their links on The Gridlock discord.**

With all of this awesome-sauce sadly comes some rules. Firstly, don't be a dick. Secondly, don't remove stuff that works, especially if it's actively producing items**!** Third, use common sense and common decency when communicating with other players - we are all humans here.
