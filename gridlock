Breaking News: The Gridlock Cluster - a Clusterio MMO event - is launching on June 12th!

The Gridlock cluster is simple: it's a pre-set grid of servers each connected by teleporting trains (that are ALL trying to kill you), all working to avoid the worst nightmare an engineer can face... a train deadlock!

The master server node will be enabled from the starting location, and then new servers will be attached constantly enabling new players to join the event, no whitelisting required.

Attached? Yes, new servers will need a landing party of engineers who will be stripped of their power armour and then sent in to establish a base of operations. Only after all the biters on the map are cleared and a satellite launched, will they be enabled to send and receive shipments via the teleporting death trains! 

The amount of biters and ore will vary from server to server, mostly depending on a blessing from the RNG gods and a curse from the Gridlock Staff.

The inital goal is to beat our previous record of over **2 million satellites launched** in the last event (which should have blocked out the sun!). But we thought that maybe the sun *should* be blocked out! So be warned as more nodes join and as more research is done, the sunlight will slowly be blocked out over time! Remember the bigger biters like attacking at night time!

Engineer, your mission - should you choose to accept it - is to join us, starting with the inital launch on **July 12, 2019 at 19:00/7pm UTC**. There will always be new servers coming online that will need to be cleared and a rocket launched for cloud establishment, as well as established servers that will require optimising to launch as many satellites as possible and completely block out the sun this time!

Required mods are:
NONE! - We are running scenarios instead!

Please note that we are running a soft-whitelist, meaning that after a node has been cleared of biters some restrictions - but not total lockout - will be applied as a precaution. However, you can apply for whitelist access on the discord guild - and any particpants from the last event will have full access already.

An immense "thank you" to our sponsor, UpCloud! They are providing us with all the servers for the event, which are more than up to the challenge with some awesome hardware.

If you are [TBD pitch about UpCloud's services], check them out and recieve [TBD discount] with code "GRIDLOCK".

=====
The primary communication channel will be on a dedicated "Gridlock Cluster" discord guild. You can join at [vanity URL] to talk about the event and plan attacks on future nodes, with dedicated voice and text channels.

The launch and subsequent work will be recorded and streamed by several partner Content Creators, and you can find their links on the Gridlock discord.

With all of this awesome-sauce sadly comes some rules. Firstly, don't be a dick. Secondly, don't remove stuff that works, especially if it's actively producing items**!** Third, use common sense and common decency when communicating with other players - we are all humans here.

And lastly, a special thanks to:

Zr4g0n, the crazy mastermind behind it all! and gfx work

Danielv123 for creating the Clusterio mod and its backend and putting a lot of dev time to prepare for the big event

AreYouScared and /u/TheOrangeAnglefor helping coordinate things 
  
The Explosive Gaming, FactorioMMO, and RedMew communities for providing team members to staff our battlestations

JD-Plays and many others for polishing many things late at night, including this post 

Cooldude2606 for gfx work and the online map

Godmave also working his butt off on Clusterio Code and making our trains teleport

Cortex and Gerkiz for also working on the Clusterio code

/u/psihius - the burned out guy from clusterio 60k who somehow found himself managing the event for a second time

How does it work?
Clusterio is magic that allows multiple nodes (aka servers) to send items and trains to each other, as well as sync researched technologies and the player's inventory. This can be done with a mod or scenario, as well as some server-side magic.
